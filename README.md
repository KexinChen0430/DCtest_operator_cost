# DCtest_operator_cost
Testing the area, delay, and power of different operators using DC under the same benchmark and setting

The library used in this evaluation is the lsi_10k.db standard cell library, which is based on a CMOS technology process. We employ a unified benchmark, where both the inputs and outputs are 4-bit binary numbers, with the sole distinction being the choice of operators. Despite the consistency in benchmark conditions, the synthesis handling of different arithmetic and logical operators in the Design Compiler differs, leading to the generation of different hardware architectures. During the synthesis process, DC generates the corresponding hardware circuits based on the semantics of the operators, which may involve various components such as control logic, adders, multipliers, shifters, or multiplexers. Therefore, even under the same benchmark conditions, different operators result in variations in the hardware implementation, which in turn affect metrics such as area, power, and delay.
